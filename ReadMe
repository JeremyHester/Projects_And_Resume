Hello,

Welcome to my Github! I am an electrical engineering student at Texas State University in the Computer Engineering concentration and my graduation date is December 2023.
I am passionate about how technology is integrated into our lives and the ways that we can utilize it for quality of life improvements.
My previous projects span analog and digital applications within the electrical world, and I particularly enjoy microprocessor applications. 

I appreciate you taking the time to view my projects and resume, and if you would like to contact me I have listed my email below. Thank you, and take care!
